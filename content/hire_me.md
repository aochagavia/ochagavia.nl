# Hire me

Interested in working together? Hit me up at <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#97;&#100;&#111;&#108;&#102;&#111;&#64;&#111;&#99;&#104;&#97;&#103;&#97;&#118;&#105;&#97;&#46;&#110;&#108;">&#97;&#100;&#111;&#108;&#102;&#111;&#64;&#111;&#99;&#104;&#97;&#103;&#97;&#118;&#105;&#97;&#46;&#110;&#108;</a>! Interested in discussing something else? Hit me up anyway :)

Things I can do for you:

* __Systems programming__. I thrive when a programming challenge involves a technical deep dive. For previous contracts I've [implemented the MySQL wire protocol as a library]({{< ref "/blog/2022-mysql-library.md" >}}), [created container images without Dockerfiles]({{< ref "/blog/2023-crafting-oci-images.md" >}}), [developed a CDCL dependency solver]({{< ref "/blog/2023-magic-dependency-resolution.md" >}}), and more.
* __Open source development__. I've been involved as a [contributor to the Rust ecosystem since 2014]({{< ref "/blog/2022-how-i-got-involved-in-rust.md" >}}). Nowadays, organizations hire me to boost open source projects: designing, implementing and polishing features that would otherwise be postponed because of limited developer bandwidth. For an example, check out [this article]({{< ref "/blog/2024-continuous-benchmarking-rustls.md" >}}) about a recent contract with [ISRG](https://www.abetterinternet.org/) (makers of [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)). Other past open source clients were [Prefix.dev](https://prefix.dev/) and [Stormshield](https://www.stormshield.com/).
* __Consulting__. Next to "hardcore programming", I also help companies develop their technical strategy, distill clear requirements from fuzzy interactions with stakeholders, constructively discuss software architecture improvements, foster team collaboration through agile coaching, and more.

#### Testimonials

_The excerpts below are taken from received [LinkedIn recommendations](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adolfoochagavia/)._

Josh Aas, co-founder of [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) and director of [ISRG](https://www.abetterinternet.org/):

> [Adolfo] put together a clear plan, iterated on it (...), and then did an excellent job implementing it (...). I would absolutely have Adolfo work on projects for us again in the future.

Dirkjan Ochtman ([@djc](https://github.com/djc/)), open source maintainer of [well-known Rust crates](https://github.com/sponsors/djc):

> Adolfo was able to quickly get up to speed with our open source project (...). He was eager to tackle our feedback to pull requests, and a very pleasant person to interact with. Highly recommend working with him!

Wolf Vollprecht ([@wolfv](https://github.com/wolfv/)), founder and CEO of [Prefix.dev](https://prefix.dev/):

> We can absolutely recommend working with Adolfo on challenging computer science problems.

Jeroen Heijmans ([@jeroenheijmans](https://github.com/jeroenheijmans/)), CTO at Infi Utrecht:

> His technical skills make him part of the top 1%, even regardless of the specific technology!

Matthew Quinn, software engineer:

> I have to credit a great deal of my skills already to the advice and guidance that he has provided me with over this past year.

#### Technologies of choice

Given enough time, I am able to get familiar with whatever technology you are using. There is a chance I am already acquainted with your tech stack, since in the past I have worked in the .NET, Java, Rust, Erlang and Node.js ecosystems (and experimented with a few more).

When evaluating new projects, I have a strong preference for statically typed languages, because they align better with my way of thinking. Also, I prefer ecosystems with mature tooling, so I can focus on the essential aspects of the problem (instead of being bogged down by accidental complexity).

#### Ways of working together

* __Solo__. I am a _very_ intrinsically motivated person, and have a proven track record delivering high-quality work with little guidance. I proactively ask the right questions, and know where to look for answers. I am also able to summarize and explain my findings, in such a way that you can follow my progress without being burdened with the day-to-day minutiae of the project.
* __Enhancing your team__. Peers see me as a highly talented and pleasant team member (see [testimonials](#testimonials) above). My technical skills are boosted by the capacity to effectively collaborate with others: I feel comfortable mentoring junior programmers, solving architectural challenges with experienced developers, interfacing with business stakeholders, and more. If you are looking to enhance your team, I'd be happy to be on board.

#### Practicalities

* __Location__. I am based in Amsterdam and have a preference for remote work (on-site might be possible if your team is in Amsterdam).
* __Working across time zones__. I have experience collaborating with colleagues in different time zones (US and Europe). This is definitely an option as long as the work is compatible with asynchronous communication.
* __Working hours__. I am interested in contracts for 3 days a week, 8 hours a day. On a case-by-case basis, 4 days a week might also be possible.
* __Languages__. I am fully proficient in English, Dutch and Spanish.
* __Company__. I am registered as a one-person company (eenmanszaak) at the Dutch Chamber of Commerce, under number 80893503.
* __Legal__. I work under <a href="/files/NLdigital Terms - EN.pdf">these terms and conditions</a> (also available in <a href="/files/NLdigital Voorwaarden - NL.pdf">Dutch</a>). They are required by my insurance, but we might deviate from them if there are good reasons to do so and we agree to limit my liability.
