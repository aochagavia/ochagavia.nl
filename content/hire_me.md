I am available as a freelance software developer, mentor and consultant. You can reach me at <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#97;&#100;&#111;&#108;&#102;&#111;&#64;&#111;&#99;&#104;&#97;&#103;&#97;&#118;&#105;&#97;&#46;&#110;&#108;">&#97;&#100;&#111;&#108;&#102;&#111;&#64;&#111;&#99;&#104;&#97;&#103;&#97;&#118;&#105;&#97;&#46;&#110;&#108;</a>.

Things I can do for you:

* __Prototyping and R&D__. I particularly enjoy technical challenges where the solution is more complex than using a ready-made framework. Do you need to implement a custom network protocol? No problem. Is there no library to help you achieve your goals? I can write it. Are you unsure about the best technical solution for the problem? We can figure it out.
* __Open source development__. As a member of the open source community, I would gladly contribute to any open source projects your company depends upon: identifying pain points you have as a user, engaging with the project's community to design necessary improvements, and submitting pull requests that implement them.
* __Team enhancement__. You already have a development team, but would welcome a highly talented, passionate and caring team member. Someone who not only helps deliver new features, but also has an eye for the overall architecture and dares to challenge the status quo in healthy doses.
* __Coaching__. I love teaching. Through conversations, presentations, code reviews, pair programming, you name it. I can help by sharing my passion and experience about topics such as functional programming patterns, test-driven development, misuse-resistant API design, open source development, etc.
* __Whatever else comes to your mind__. I have intentionally kept the list above as short as possible, but there are probably more things I could do for you. From bizarre ideas like giving a workshop about Plato and programming, to more conventional stuff such as helping you adopt the Rust programming language. Feel free to reach out if you would like to discuss!

#### Technologies of choice

Given enough time, I am able to get familiar with whatever technology you are using. There is a chance I am already acquainted with your tech stack, since in the past I have worked with the .NET, Java, Rust, Erlang and NPM ecosystems.

When evaluating new projects, I have a strong preference for statically typed languages, because they align better with the way I think. Also, I prefer languages with good IDE support, because they make refactoring and maintenance much easier.

#### Testimonials

Jeroen Heijmans, CTO at Infi Utrecht:

> At Infi I've had the pleasure of working together with Adolfo. His technical skills make him part of the top 1%, even regardless of the specific technology! He was ever thoughtful in his interactions with colleagues, other team members, and clients. Always finding a great balance between being pragmatic and not avoiding any hard discussions or problems. If you consider doing a project or work together with Adolfo I can highly recommend doing so!

Matthew Quinn, software engineer:

> When I first started working with iChoosr, there was an enormous amount of different systems, rules and standards to learn. Adolfo played an integral part in getting me up to speed and helping me to improve as a developer, and a team member. At the start he took an active role in mentoring me through pair programming, code reviews, and taking time to talk and get to know me. His warm character and deep technical knowledge had a way of empowering me and raising my confidence in my own technical abilities. I have found him a very supportive colleague, who has put a lot of effort into making my time with this team so pleasant. I have to credit a great deal of my skills already to the advice and guidance that he has provided me with over this past year. From pair programming, to code reviews, to mentoring, Adolfo is your man!

#### Practicalities

* __Location__. I am based in Utrecht, The Netherlands, and have a preference for remote work (on-site might be possible in particular cases).
* __Working across time zones__. I am open to collaborating with colleagues in different time zones, if the kind of work is compatible with asynchronous communication and we make sure to sync through a video call once in a while.
* __Teamwork vs. standalone__. Depending on your needs, I can work in a team or by myself.
* __Languages__. I am fully proficient in English, Dutch and Spanish.
