Did my blog pique your interest? Great to hear! This page will give you more information about what I do. If you are considering working together, feel free to contact me at <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#97;&#100;&#111;&#108;&#102;&#111;&#64;&#111;&#99;&#104;&#97;&#103;&#97;&#118;&#105;&#97;&#46;&#110;&#108;">&#97;&#100;&#111;&#108;&#102;&#111;&#64;&#111;&#99;&#104;&#97;&#103;&#97;&#118;&#105;&#97;&#46;&#110;&#108;</a>, so we can figure out if there is a match between what you need and what I have to offer.

Things I can do for you:

* __Systems programming__. My skills are especially geared towards technical challenges where the solution is more complex than using a ready-made framework. Examples include [implementing the MySQL protocol as a library]({{< ref "/blog/2022-mysql-library.md" >}}), [creating container images without Dockerfiles]({{< ref "/blog/2023-crafting-oci-images.md" >}}), and [developing a package manager]({{< ref "/blog/2023-birth-package-manager.md" >}}).
* __Open source Rust development__. Backed by my [experience as a contributor]({{< ref "/blog/2022-how-i-got-involved-in-rust.md" >}}) to the Rust open source ecosystem, and by a strong ability to find my way in new codebases, I am used to contributing to open source projects on behalf of companies. In [this article]({{< ref "/blog/2023-birth-package-manager.md" >}}) you can read more about my recent engagement with [Prefix.dev](https://prefix.dev), and about my current engagement with [Stormshield](https://www.stormshield.com/).
* __Technical writing__. As you can probably deduce from my blog, I _love_ sharing ideas with others through writing. During my engagements, I make sure to take note of all interesting things I come across, so I can tell the world about them (with your permission). For me it is a way of giving back to the programmer community, while at the same time offering people the chance to see how interesting your business is.

Ways of working together:

* __Within a team__. Colleagues see me as a [highly talented, passionate and caring team member](#testimonials). Someone who not only helps deliver new features, but also has an eye for the overall architecture and dares to challenge the status quo in healthy doses. If you are looking to enhance your team, I'd be happy to be on board.
* __Solo__. I am a _very_ intrinsically motivated person, and have no problem organizing myself to deliver high-quality work with little guidance. I proactively ask the right questions, and know where to look for answers. I am also able to summarize and explain my findings, in such a way that you can follow my progress without being burdened with the day-to-day minutiae of the project.

#### Technologies of choice

Given enough time, I am able to get familiar with whatever technology you are using. There is a chance I am already acquainted with your tech stack, since in the past I have worked in the .NET, Java, Rust, Erlang and NPM ecosystems.

When evaluating new projects, I have a strong preference for statically typed languages, because they align better with my way of thinking. Also, I prefer languages with good IDE support, because they make refactoring and maintenance much easier.

#### Testimonials

Jeroen Heijmans, CTO at Infi Utrecht:

> At Infi I've had the pleasure of working together with Adolfo. His technical skills make him part of the top 1%, even regardless of the specific technology! He was ever thoughtful in his interactions with colleagues, other team members, and clients. Always finding a great balance between being pragmatic and not avoiding any hard discussions or problems. If you consider doing a project or work together with Adolfo I can highly recommend doing so!

Matthew Quinn, software engineer:

> When I first started working with iChoosr, there was an enormous amount of different systems, rules and standards to learn. Adolfo played an integral part in getting me up to speed and helping me to improve as a developer, and a team member. At the start he took an active role in mentoring me through pair programming, code reviews, and taking time to talk and get to know me. His warm character and deep technical knowledge had a way of empowering me and raising my confidence in my own technical abilities. I have found him a very supportive colleague, who has put a lot of effort into making my time with this team so pleasant. I have to credit a great deal of my skills already to the advice and guidance that he has provided me with over this past year. From pair programming, to code reviews, to mentoring, Adolfo is your man!

#### Practicalities

* __Location__. I am based in Utrecht, The Netherlands, and have a preference for remote work (on-site might be possible in particular cases).
* __Working across time zones__. I am open to collaborating with colleagues in different time zones, if the kind of work is compatible with asynchronous communication and we make sure to sync through a video call once in a while.
* __Working hours__. I have a preference for working 3 days a week, 8 hours a day (after all, there is more to life than programming).
* __Languages__. I am fully proficient in English, Dutch and Spanish.
* __Company__. I am registered as a one-person company (eenmanszaak) at the Dutch Chamber of Commerce, under number 80893503.
* <a href="/files/NLdigital Terms - EN.pdf">Terms and conditions</a> (also available in <a href="/files/NLdigital Voorwaarden - NL.pdf">Dutch</a>). These are required by my insurance, but we might deviate from them if there are good reasons to do so and we have a clear agreement regarding liability.
