Hi! I'm Adolfo, a software engineer living in Amsterdam (The Netherlands). I [was first bitten by the programming bug during my early teens]({{< ref "/blog/2022-how-i-got-into-programming.md" >}}) and, after pursuing a master's degree in Computer Science, ended up turning my passion into my profession.

Along the way, I [helped shape the Rust programming language]({{< ref "/blog/2022-how-i-got-involved-in-rust.md" >}}) and contributed extensively to its open source ecosystem. Nowadays I [offer my services]({{< ref "/hire_me" >}}) in the form of systems programming, boosting open source projects and consulting. <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#97;&#100;&#111;&#108;&#102;&#111;&#64;&#111;&#99;&#104;&#97;&#103;&#97;&#118;&#105;&#97;&#46;&#110;&#108;">Shoot me an email</a> if you'd like to hire me!
