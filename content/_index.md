Hi! I'm Adolfo, a computer scientist with strong technical skills and a deep passion for technology. I [wrote my first program when I was 14]({{< ref "/blog/2022-how-i-got-into-programming.md" >}}) and have been honing my skills daily ever since. During my time at the university, I had the privilege to get [involved in the development of the Rust programming language]({{< ref "/blog/2022-how-i-got-involved-in-rust.md" >}}). After some time working professionally for a company, I [became an independent contractor]({{< ref "/blog/2023-becoming-contractor.md" >}}) in 2020.

Check out the [hire me]({{< ref "/hire_me" >}}) page if you want to know more about my work or to explore the possibility of working together.
