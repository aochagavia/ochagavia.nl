#### Key areas of expertise

I'm currently offering the following services:

* __Systems programming__. I thrive when a programming challenge involves a technical deep dive. For instance, I recently designed and implemented a container image builder, registry and runtime in collaboration with [Outerbounds](https://outerbounds.com) (see [this article](https://outerbounds.com/blog/faster-cloud-compute) for details and benchmarks). Other past consulting engagements include [implementing the MySQL wire protocol as a library]({{< ref "/blog/2022-mysql-library.md" >}}), [developing a CDCL dependency solver]({{< ref "/blog/2023-magic-dependency-resolution.md" >}}), and [creating a continuous benchmarking system for the popular rustls library]({{< ref "/blog/2024-continuous-benchmarking-rustls.md" >}}).
* __Boosting Rust open source projects__. I've been [contributing to the Rust ecosystem since 2014]({{< ref "/blog/2022-how-i-got-involved-in-rust.md" >}}). I'm used to designing, implementing and polishing features in collaboration with project maintainers. For an example, check out [this article]({{< ref "/blog/2024-continuous-benchmarking-rustls.md" >}}) about a project for [ISRG](https://www.abetterinternet.org/) (makers of [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)). Other past customers were [Prefix.dev](https://prefix.dev/), [Stormshield](https://www.stormshield.com/) and the [Solana Foundation](https://solana.org/).
* __Free-form consulting__. If there's anything else you feel I could help with, let's talk and find out whether my skills could bring you closer to a solution.

Dirkjan Ochtman ([@djc](https://github.com/djc/)), open source maintainer of [well-known Rust crates](https://github.com/sponsors/djc):

> Adolfo was able to quickly get up to speed with our open source project (...). He was eager to tackle our feedback to pull requests, and a very pleasant person to interact with. Highly recommend working with him!

#### Technologies of choice

My strongest stacks are Rust and .NET (C#). I also have work experience in TypeScript, Go, Java, Python, Elixir and C. Given enough time, I'm able to get familiar with whatever technology you are using.

#### Ways of working together

* __Solo__. I am a _very_ intrinsically motivated person, and have a proven track record delivering high-quality work with little guidance. I proactively ask the right questions to clarify assumptions and goals, and I research my way forward through any obstacles that might appear. I am also able to summarize and explain a project's progress in such a way that you can follow along without being burdened with day-to-day minutiae.
* __Team__. Peers see me as a highly talented and pleasant team member (see [testimonials](#testimonials) above). My technical skills are accompanied by the capacity to effectively collaborate with others: I feel comfortable mentoring junior programmers, solving architectural challenges with experienced developers, interfacing with business stakeholders, and more. If you are looking to boost your team, I'd be happy to be on board.

#### Practicalities

* __Location__. I am based in Amsterdam and have a preference for remote work.
* __Working across time zones__. I have experience collaborating with colleagues in different time zones (mainly US and Europe).
* __Working hours__. I am interested in projects for 3 to 4 days a week, 8 hours a day.
* __Languages__. I am fully proficient in English, Dutch and Spanish.
* __Company__. I am registered as a one-person company (eenmanszaak) at the Dutch Chamber of Commerce, under number 80893503.
* __Legal__. I work under <a href="/files/NLdigital Terms - EN.pdf">these terms and conditions</a> (also available in <a href="/files/NLdigital Voorwaarden - NL.pdf">Dutch</a>).
