Roughly two months ago I [posted]({{< ref "/blog/2024-joys-of-the-craft.md" >}}) a fragment of Fred Brooks' *The Mythical Man-Month*, which I find particularly inspiring. And guess what... I'm not the only one who feels touched by that passage! Upon reading it, a friend sent me the following message, which I include here with his permission: _WOWWWWWW, THIS IS BEAUTIFUL. It's exactly what I felt last weeks but could not put into words![^1]_

Motivated by his reaction, I thought about other texts I've come across that inspire me as a programmer and as a human being. Today I want to share fragments of two poems that, in my eyes, embody the curiosity and sense of wonder that pervade my work and, to some extent, my life.

By the way, I'm restraining myself from explaining _why_ exactly these poems move me... I'd rather let them speak for themselves, instead of distracting you with my words. If you really want to know what I think, I'm just an email away!

And now, I leave you in the hands of Chesterton and Tolkien. See you next time!

### A second childhood - G. K. Chesterton

> When all my days are ending\
> And I have no song to sing,\
> I think that I shall not be too old\
> To stare at everything;\
> As I stared once at a nursery door\
> Or a tall tree and a swing.
>
> (...)
>
> Men grow too old for love, my love,\
> Men grow too old for wine,\
> But I shall not grow too old to see\
> Unearthly daylight shine,\
> Changing my chamberâ€™s dust to snow\
> Till I doubt if it be mine.
>
> (...)
>
> Behold, the crowning mercies melt,\
> The first surprises stay;\
> And in my dross is dropped a gift\
> For which I dare not pray:\
> That a man grow used to grief and joy\
> But not to night and day.

### I sit beside the fire and think - J. R. R. Tolkien

_Context: this is a fragment of a song by Bilbo, which he sings to Frodo in The Fellowship of the Ring._

> I sit beside the fire and think\
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of all that I have seen,\
> of meadow-flowers and butterflies\
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in summers that have been;
>
> Of yellow leaves and gossamer\
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in autumns that there were,\
> with morning mist and silver sun\
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and wind upon my hair.
>
> I sit beside the fire and think\
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of how the world will be\
> when winter comes without a spring\
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that I shall ever see.
>
> For still there are so many things\
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that I have never seen:\
> in every wood in every spring\
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there is a different green.
