If you have been following my previous posts on Rust's drop order,
you may want to know how it all ended. In january, I summarized my
research in an RFC and submitted it for consideration of the Rust
community. Today, after six months of discussion (with around 80
replies), it has been finally accepted as [RFC 1857][rfc]!

Besides reading the RFC itself, you may want to check my previous posts
to see the reasoning that led to it:

* [Enforcing drop order]({{< ref "blog/2016-rust-enforcing-drop-order.md" >}})
* [Exploring drop order]({{< ref "blog/2016-exploring-rust-drop-order.md" >}})
* [Changing drop order]({{< ref "blog/2016-thoughts-on-changing-drop-order.md" >}})
