Hello there! In case you felt inspired by my previous article on [The Undercover Generalist]({{< ref "/blog/2024-undercover-generalist.md" >}}), you'll like to hear I was invited to The Changelog podcast to talk a bit more about it. Thanks to the random person who got my article on The Changelog's radar in the first place!

Below is an embedded player, for those of you who want to listen to it. The Changelog will soon publish the transcript on [their website](https://changelog.com/friends/37), which you might prefer if podcasts are not your thing (you can ask to be notified when it's available). Enjoy!
