Hi! I am Adolfo, a computer scientist with strong technical skills and a deep passion for technology. I [wrote my first program when I was 14]({{< ref "/blog/2022-how-i-got-into-programming.md" >}}) and have been honing my skills daily ever since. During my time at the university, I had the privilege to get [involved in the development of the Rust programming language]({{< ref "/blog/2022-how-i-got-involved-in-rust.md" >}}). In 2020 I started a consulting business, which you can read more about [here]({{< ref "/hire_me" >}}).

Outside the realm of computers and programming, my interests cover a broad range of topics, such as philosophy, literature and music.
